# Eric's Shortcuts

This website was made so that you can add it to your homescreen on IOS or Android and have an area you can store websites that you may commonly visit and have an area that you can quickly get to them at any time.

This uses local storage, so can be used on however many devices without other people being able to see what you have saved.

This also works offline due to having a service worker script, so if you have no internet that is no problem (no clue why you would be trying to visit a website anyways)

I would've loved to have made this as an actual app but £100 a year by Apple is an absolute scam and as a student I cannot afford that (or even half)
So, I had to make it this way unfortunately :(

### Install on Mobile (iOS/Android)
1. Open the app URL in your mobile browser
2. **iOS Safari**: Tap the Share button → "Add to Home Screen"
3. **Android Chrome**: Tap the menu (⋮) → "Add to Home Screen" or "Install App"
